    <h1>DDOS Project 1 Alec Leyner</h1>
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p> A distributed denial-of-service (DDOS) attack is the attempt to distribute traffic into the users network. This will overwhelm the target and flood the internet connection that the user is running on. DDOS attacks can happen to anybody whether it ranges from a popular youtuber in the middle of streaming and his livestream start to lag or a large corporation getting attacked and running slower than normal and not able to process whatever theyâ€™re doing, this can be a hassle to deal with. </p>
    <h3>How hackers use DDOS attack</h3>
    <p> DDOS attacks are carried out on multiple machines that are connected to a network. These networks are computers that have already been infected with a virus/malware which allows them to be controlled remotely for the attacker. The devices are called bots and multiple bots that are connected to the network are called botnets. What the botnets do is send multiple requests to the victims IP address creating traffic and causing the internet to not work or be very slow. </p>

    <h4>How to identify it</h4>
    <p>It is very hard to identify it at first because there really are no major warnings for when it's going to happen. Some hackers will send threats but for the majority of the time they will stay quiet about it. Some ways to identify the attack while it's occurring is if your server is responding by saying 503 errors due to service outage or an address makes x requests over y seconds. DDOS attacks are illegal, if you are able to identify the person or IP that sent you this attack, they can go to jail or serve time for implementing this attack, especially on large corporations. </p>
